# SBE: Spin-3/2 Bloch Equation
SBE is an ISTO-based description of spin-3/2 nuclei, such as 23Na, in biological tissue.

*SBE.m* calculates the integral of SBE using MATLAB solver *ode45*.

[The Melbourne Brain Centre Imaging Unit (MBCIU) repository](https://github.com/MBCIU/Sodium_spin_dynamics_simulation) is the official SBE repository.
